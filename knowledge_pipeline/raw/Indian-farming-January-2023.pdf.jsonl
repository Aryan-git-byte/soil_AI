The people have paid attention towards millet (pearl millet, sorghum, finger millet, little millet, barnyard millet, kodo millet) for their role in combating challenges of malnutrition and hunger in various countries. These millets possess greater amount of nutritional substances than wheat, rice and maize. Millets are resilient and rain-fed crops that thrive in dry regions and grow well in conditions of low soil fertility and moisture with less inputs. Growing millets is a step towards sustainability and food security. Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has also stressed the importance of making millets a future food option. Several countries are organizing myriad of programmes to make aware the public about nutritional usefulness of the millets. I am happy to note that advantages of farming of millets and their food products and nutritional facts of these products have been documented in this unique issue. I wish success to this souvenir issue. Best wishes for the New Year 2023. (Kailash Choudhary) 4 Indian Farming January 2023"}

This is the opportune time for special issue in view of International Year of Millets being observed in 2023 across the globe. Millets, termed as ‘nutri-cereals’ enjoy the indispensable place in Indian dietary system, since time immemorial. Post-Green Revolution, the acreage of millets decreased due to area expansion under irrigation and consequent area shift towards wheat, rice and maize. It is imperative to create awareness among the masses and farmers about the nutritional, health and environmental value of millets. This special issue provides precise knowledge, scientific facts, and technology on millets. The key achievements made by ICAR’s institutes in these nutri-cereals have been documented. However, the millets were grown in sizeable area due to their resilience in against climatic stresses and withstand under water stressed conditions. I hope that the information provided through this special issue, shall be of immense use to farming community and serve as our magnum opus on millets covering their important aspects for benefit of the masses. I wish to congratulate all authors and the team of editors involved in this publication and a great success to International Year of Millets, 2023. (Himanshu Pathak) 6 Indian Farming January 2023"}

Millets are small seeded crops from grass family that are hardy and grow well in arid and semi-arid ecosystem mostly as rainfed crops under low soil fertility and moisture condition on marginal lands. These are resilient to high temperatures and drought prone environments; require only 350 mm water as compared to 1200 mm for rice. Millets being highly adaptable to different ecological conditions are ideal crops for climate change and contingency planting. Important millet crops grown in India are sorghum (great millet), bajra (pearl millet), ragi or mandua (finger millet), and small millets such as kutki or same (little millet), sanwa or jhangon (barnyard millet), kangni or kakun (foxtail millet), cheena (proso millet), kodo (kodo millet) and korale (brown top millet). These are traditional crops with high nutritional value and health benefits. According to FAO, the world’s production of millets is 89.17 million tonnes from an area of 74 million hectare (2019–20). India is a global leader in production of millets (17.9 million tonnes, 2020–21) that are cultivated in 21 states in an area of about 12.5 million hectare with a share of more than 15% of the world’s total production. Cultivation with low productivity, lack of good quality seeds, lesser shelf-life, lack of machineries for processing, absence of market linkages, lack of uniformity, standard and grades are the major problems related to millets. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) through Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR) and AICRP Project on Millets has succeeded in development of more than 90 varieties for different agro-climatic regions so far. Recently Prime Minister of India dedicated to the nation ICAR developed 3 bio-fortified varieties of millets (Finger millets, CFMN-1,2, Small millet CCLMN) with high iron and zinc contents on the occasion of 75th Anniversary of UN FAO. Apart from evolving high yielding varieties, focus has been on the development of value-chain ecosystem. To promote millet production, the undersigned, then Agriculture Commissioner developed and implemented new Sub-Mission on Nutri-cereals (Millets) under National Food Security Mission Programme in the year 2018 to increase area, production and productivity of millets in 212 districts of 14 states. Consequently, the production of millets has increased from 13.7 million (2018–19) to 17.9 million tonnes (2020–21). The other important decisions taken were changing the name from millets to nutri-cereals through a Gazette Notification of Government of India in April 2018, implementation of National Year of Millets 2018, launching of breeder seed production at 18 centers and creation of 25 seed hubs at ICAR-AICRP and KVK’s. To create domestic and global demand and to provide nutritional food to people, Government of India proposed to UN for declaring 2023 as International Year of Millets. The undersigned got the opportunity to present the proposal in UN FAO, Rome Committee on Agriculture (5 October 2018), and also in UN FAO Council (3 December 2018) which was endorsed and declared by UN on 5 March 2021. Now, India will take lead at global level as a guiding country for observance of International Year of Millets 2023. It is a matter of pride for all of us that Indian Council of Agricultural Research has got the lead role to play for promotion of millets as nutri- solution to climate and food. I call upon all stakeholders to actively participate and contribute for furtherance of nutri-cereals called millets globally through pre-run activities conducted by Government of India in the current year as well as next year.

COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE Twenty-sixth Session Rome, 1 - 5 October 2018 Proposal for an International Year of Millets Executive Summary Millets are often called \"Nutri-Cereals\" due to their high nutritional content compared to the more commonly grown cereals; wheat, rice or corn. When millets are included in diets, human and animal health is significantly improved, including that of mothers and their young. Here Millets may encompass a diverse group of cereals that include pearl, proso, foxtail, barnyard, little, kodo, browntop, finger and Guinea millets plus fonio, sorgum (or great millet) and teff. Millets were among the first plants that were domesticated and have served as a traditional staple crop for millions of farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Millets can grow on poor soils with little or no inputs, are resistant or tolerant to many crop diseases and pests and can survive adverse climatic conditions. The genetic diversity of millets offer opportunities for economic development through income generating activities in the food sector or on niche markets for specific professional applications (therapeutics, pharmaceuticals, specialty chemistry). To respond to the challenges posed today by increasing populations and associated food insecurity The FAO COAG (1–5 October 2018) reviewed the and changes in climate, the Government of India is seeking FAO support to the next agenda of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), to adopt the proposal for an International Year of Millets proposal presented by the Govt. of India to establish (Annex). The Government of India recently increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of millets observance of the International Year of Millets 2023 by 50 percent of cost of production to achieve the national commitment of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.

One of the main reasons for the low productivity and performance of our livestock is malnutrition and under-nutrition owing to inadequate supply of nutritive fodder and feed. The country is highly deficient with respect to availability of green fodder, dry fodder and concentrates. The gaps for fodder supply are partly met by crop residues-straw and stovers. As the millets are the major cereals of dryland crops in arid and semi-arid regions, they form an important source of stover for the livestock of these regions. Keywords: Fodder, Fodder quality, Green fodder, Millets, Stover THE farm communities in the semi-arid and arid nutrients is better in millet stovers as compared to regions of the country are dependent on crop slender straws of paddy and wheat.

Once the students become familiar with these basic concepts, they can easily understand the other properties of the soil, say physical and biological properties, pedology and soil fertility. To become an expert of soil fertility, comprehensive knowledge of all the soil properties is essential which in turn is supported by the knowledge of physical chemistry of soils and soil mineralogy. The present Textbook on ‘Physical Chemistry and Mineralogy of Soils’ has been written very cogently by the author who has been a teacher with an experience of nearly four decades of teaching in a premier Institute that is ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute. The book includes all the topics prescribed by ICAR for the Postgraduate students of Soil Science. The introductory chapter describes basic definitions of soil science. Chapters like ‘Bonding in solid structures’, ‘Elements of crystallography’, ‘Chemical thermodynamics’ and ‘Electrochemistry of soils and clays’ are basic in nature and have been dealt very lucidly for easy understanding of students. Two chapters on characterisation of soil minerals are practical oriented. Other chapters focus on the structures of soil minerals, weathering and formation of minerals in soil environment, adsorption and ion exchange on soil colloids, double layer theory of soil colloids–its evolution and application, chemisorption and precipitation reactions in soil, soil organic colloids and their properties and chemistry of submerged soil. This book will be very much useful for the Postgraduate students of Soil Science.

In India, yield losses of 10–20% have been reported in millets due to insect pests. Shoot flies and stem borers are associated with millets and cause huge damage apart from many sucking pests. Few pests are newly observed attacking millets and few minor pests have become major in some regions. For most of the recently recorded pests, information on factors responsible for their outbreak, bionomics, yield losses etc is needed before planning their control operations. As an immediate remedy, chemicals have been used mainly on high yielding varieties and hybrids. However, a combination of cultural practices and resistant cultivars has proved to be effective.

They are a group of small-seeded grasses that are highly tolerant to environmental stresses and have high physiological efficiency. They are an important food security crop in many parts of the world, especially in Africa and Asia. Millets have several key adaptive traits that make them well-suited for climate resilience, including their short growing season, deep root system and ability to tolerate high temperatures and drought conditions. The importance of these crops in terms of their physiological and anatomical make up is highlighted in this article, which needs to be utilized for selection of superior and high yielding germplasm for competing the yield potential of other major cereals.

Millet crops which in arid, low-latitude conditions and are in general more include sorghum (jowar), pearl millet (bajra), finger drought tolerant, sustain elevated temperatures, are millet (ragi), foxtail millet (kangani), barnyard millet less affected by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (sanwa), proso millet (chenna), little millet (kutki) and kodo millet (kodo) are the promising crops that can cope with changing climate, sustain productivity and exhibit resilience to abiotic stresses. Their rich nutritional properties and health benefits have enabled their revival and cultivation in the recent years. Millets are considered as nutri-cereals as they hold abundant nutritional benefits, food and fodder value, ecological benefits, reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers and are less sensitive to yield declines with lower inputs. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports state that “Compared to the more commonly known cereals such as wheat, rice or corn, millets are capable of growing under drought conditions, under non-irrigated conditions even in very low rainfall regimes, having a low water footprint”. Almost all the millet crops are well known for their hardiness which can withstand prolonged periods of drought, high temperatures and still yield grains and fodder. Hence, they are considered as climate smart crops.

Biofortification in millets is a feasible strategy to alleviate the micronutrient malnutrition among the rural poor. Several biofortified cultivars have been released in pearl millet for commercial cultivation and are being adopted by the farmers. The availability of high variability for grain micronutrient contents in sorghum and small millets holds promise to develop superior cultivars with enhanced nutritional quality.

The stover from millets was an important component of livestock feed in integrated farming systems. Lack of diversity in food grains and excessive processing of rice and wheat has caused double burden of lifestyle diseases and malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiency is being manifested as ‘hidden hunger’ in many developing countries to which millets seem to be a probable salution. Millets like sorghum, pearl millet and finger millet are consumed as whole grains and are rich source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre. Small millets like foxtail, proso, little, barnyard and kodo millets are also good source of nutrients when moderately polished after dehulling. Finger millet is a very rich source of calcium for growing children, pregnant women and elderly for maintaining bone health. Therefore, regular consumption of millets helps in diversification of diets and imparts many health benefits along with battling hidden hunger. Keywords: Calcium, Dietary fibre, Micronutrients, Minerals, Vitamins MILLETS are a diverse group of tiny-grained on a cereal based staple diet as cereals are generally annual grasses cultivated widely in arid and considered deficient in micronutrients. Millets are semi-arid regions of the world. Millets were among nutritionally diverse and offer a range of micronutrients the most widely consumed cereals across many parts for consumption.

Moreover, millets exhibit superior agronomic highest amount of protein among grains (~12.5%) and benefits, viz. shorter growing periods, ability to grow in barnyard millet is an excellent source of fibre. Further, marginal lands with low inputs, resistance to drought millet grains are abundant sources of minerals and etc as compared to most other cereals. Millet grain is B-complex vitamins. commonly used for human food and animal feed, and Altogether, millets offer a broad spectrum of straw for animal feed. Also, millet grains are resistant to micronutrients and other important nutritional pests and diseases. Millets are now considered as ‘smart components, and thereby paving way for nutritional foods’ and ‘nutri-cereals’ as they contribute for food, security of the population.

HANDBOOK OF Integrated Pest Management To reverse the loss of environmental resources and also to reduce biodiversity loss, the Government of India has Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as part of the National Agricultural Policy. Integrated Pest Management emphasizes the growth of a health crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms. IPM is not new – mechanical, cultural and biological tactics were used by farmers for hundreds of years before chemical pesticides became available. Besides, there are IPM techniques that have been developed more recently and are effective in suppressing pests without adversely affecting the environment. The task of spreading the message of IPM across is tough due to poor awareness about the subject among people in line-departments as also among the farmers. The information on integrated pest management as a whole is scattered. This Handbook comprehensively deals with all the aspects of integrated pest management in field crops, horticultural crops under traditional, protected systems. Information on basic strategies and tactics of different methods of management including mass production of biocontrol agents, IPM policy and pesticide registration is provided in comprehensive form. The Handbook of Integrated Pest Management comprises 82 chapters which are well written in lucid language with crispy sentences by the renowned scientists. The role of IPM is elucidated with different pests like Trichogramma, Bacillus thuringiensis, Nomuraea rileyi etc. and agricultural crops like rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, pulses, soybean, rapeseed mustard, groundnut, minor-oilseed crops, sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta, potato, vegetable crops, fruits, grapes, citrus, banana, pomegranate, coconut etc. This Handbook will provide information of available useful technologies to educate on how to reduce or judiciously use chemical pesticides, safeguard ourselves from chronic poisoning, save the National environment while also reducing input costs and raise farmers’ income. This compilation will be useful to teachers, students, trainers, line-department personnel and policy makers.

Most of the fallow lands in summer can be brought into proso millet cultivation with limited irrigation, which will generate additional income if grown as an intercrop. Proso millet is a good source of plant-based protein and its value addition can enhance acceptance among consumers. The demand for millets has increased many folds, the market linkages are in incipient stage but sooner the market will face scarcity of raw material for making value added products. The major constraint of millet cultivation was yield, but with the availability of improved cultivars and practices, farmers can harvest profitable yields. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: avinash@millets.res.in Proso millet panicle Indian Farming 111 January 2023"}

The value chain approach thus provided end sorghum flakes and sorghum biscuits/cookies. Suitable to end solutions and forward integration is enabled for packaging, labeling, marketing and pricing strategies processing and commercialization by the small and are adopted for targeting them to urban markets. These medium scale entrepreneurs. interventions made possible to provide convenient options for consumers among sorghum foods. 1Principal Scientist, 2General Manager–New Intiatives, ITC (ABD) Policy sensitization Ltd., 3Scientist F, National Institute for Nutrition, 4Professor, PJTSAU, Hyderabad, 5Scientist, IIMR First initiative on public private partnership (PPP) in Access Digital Copies of Indian Farming at https://epubs.icar.org.in 116 Indian Farming January 2023"}

The people have paid attention towards millet (pearl millet, sorghum, finger millet, little millet, barnyard millet, kodo millet) for their role in combating challenges of malnutrition and hunger in various countries. These millets possess greater amount of nutritional substances than wheat, rice and maize. Millets are resilient and rain-fed crops that thrive in dry regions and grow well in conditions of low soil fertility and moisture with less inputs. Growing millets is a step towards sustainability and food security. Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has also stressed the importance of making millets a future food option. Several countries are organizing myriad of programmes to make aware the public about nutritional usefulness of the millets. I am happy to note that advantages of farming of millets and their food products and nutritional facts of these products have been documented in this unique issue. I wish success to this souvenir issue. Best wishes for the New Year 2023. (Kailash Choudhary) 4 Indian Farming January 2023"}

This is the opportune time for special issue in view of International Year of Millets being observed in 2023 across the globe. Millets, termed as ‘nutri-cereals’ enjoy the indispensable place in Indian dietary system, since time immemorial. Post-Green Revolution, the acreage of millets decreased due to area expansion under irrigation and consequent area shift towards wheat, rice and maize. It is imperative to create awareness among the masses and farmers about the nutritional, health and environmental value of millets. This special issue provides precise knowledge, scientific facts, and technology on millets. The key achievements made by ICAR’s institutes in these nutri-cereals have been documented. However, the millets were grown in sizeable area due to their resilience in against climatic stresses and withstand under water stressed conditions. I hope that the information provided through this special issue, shall be of immense use to farming community and serve as our magnum opus on millets covering their important aspects for benefit of the masses.

{"source": "Indian-farming-January-2023.pdf", "section": "page_11", "text": "E DITORIAL Millets are no more orphan crops From the time immemorial, millets are one of the oldest foods known to humans and possibly first among cereal grains to be cultivated for consumption. Millets are small seeded crops from grass family that are hardy and grow well in arid and semi-arid ecosystem mostly as rainfed crops under low soil fertility and moisture condition on marginal lands. These are resilient to high temperatures and drought prone environments; require only 350 mm water as compared to 1200 mm for rice. Millets being highly adaptable to different ecological conditions are ideal crops for climate change and contingency planting. Important millet crops grown in India are sorghum (great millet), bajra (pearl millet), ragi or mandua (finger millet), and small millets such as kutki or same (little millet), sanwa or jhangon (barnyard millet), kangni or kakun (foxtail millet), cheena (proso millet), kodo (kodo millet) and korale (brown top millet). These are traditional crops with high nutritional value and health benefits. According to FAO, the world’s production of millets is 89.17 million tonnes from an area of 74 million hectare (2019–20). India is a global leader in production of millets (17.9 million tonnes, 2020–21) that are cultivated in 21 states in an area of about 12.5 million hectare with a share of more than 15% of the world’s total production. Cultivation with low productivity, lack of good quality seeds, lesser shelf-life, lack of machineries for processing, absence of market linkages, lack of uniformity, standard and grades are the major problems related to millets. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) through Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR) and AICRP Project on Millets has succeeded in development of more than 90 varieties for different agro-climatic regions so far. Recently Prime Minister of India dedicated to the nation ICAR developed 3 bio-fortified varieties of millets (Finger millets, CFMN-1,2, Small millet CCLMN) with high iron and zinc contents on the occasion of 75th Anniversary of UN FAO. Apart from evolving high yielding varieties, focus has been on the development of value-chain ecosystem. To promote millet production, the undersigned, then Agriculture Commissioner developed and implemented new Sub-Mission on Nutri-cereals (Millets) under National Food Security Mission Programme in the year 2018 to increase area, production and productivity of millets in 212 districts of 14 states. Consequently, the production of millets has increased from 13.7 million (2018–19) to 17.9 million tonnes (2020–21). The other important decisions taken were changing the name from millets to nutri-cereals through a Gazette Notification of Government of India in April 2018, implementation of National Year of Millets 2018, launching of breeder seed production at 18 centers and creation of 25 seed hubs at ICAR-AICRP and KVK’s. To create domestic and global demand and to provide nutritional food to people, Government of India proposed to UN for declaring 2023 as International Year of Millets. The undersigned got the opportunity to present the proposal in UN FAO, Rome Committee on Agriculture (5 October 2018), and also in UN FAO Council (3 December 2018) which was endorsed and declared by UN on 5 March 2021. Now, India will take lead at global level as a guiding country for observance of International Year of Millets 2023. It is a matter of pride for all of us that Indian Council of Agricultural Research has got the lead role to play for promotion of millets as nutri- solution to climate and food. I call upon all stakeholders to actively participate and contribute for furtherance of nutri-cereals called millets globally through pre-run activities conducted by Government of India in the current year as well as next year.

COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE Twenty-sixth Session Rome, 1 - 5 October 2018 Proposal for an International Year of Millets Executive Summary Millets are often called \"Nutri-Cereals\" due to their high nutritional content compared to the more commonly grown cereals; wheat, rice or corn. When millets are included in diets, human and animal health is significantly improved, including that of mothers and their young. Here Millets may encompass a diverse group of cereals that include pearl, proso, foxtail, barnyard, little, kodo, browntop, finger and Guinea millets plus fonio, sorgum (or great millet) and teff. Millets were among the first plants that were domesticated and have served as a traditional staple crop for millions of farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Millets can grow on poor soils with little or no inputs, are resistant or tolerant to many crop diseases and pests and can survive adverse climatic conditions. The genetic diversity of millets offer opportunities for economic development through income generating activities in the food sector or on niche markets for specific professional applications (therapeutics, pharmaceuticals, specialty chemistry). To respond to the challenges posed today by increasing populations and associated food insecurity The FAO COAG (1–5 October 2018) reviewed the and changes in climate, the Government of India is seeking FAO support to the next agenda of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), to adopt the proposal for an International Year of Millets proposal presented by the Govt. of India to establish (Annex). The Government of India recently increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of millets observance of the International Year of Millets 2023 by 50 percent of cost of production to achieve the national commitment of doubling farmers’ income by 2022.

One of the main reasons for the low productivity and performance of our livestock is malnutrition and under-nutrition owing to inadequate supply of nutritive fodder and feed. The country is highly deficient with respect to availability of green fodder, dry fodder and concentrates. The gaps for fodder supply are partly met by crop residues-straw and stovers. As the millets are the major cereals of dryland crops in arid and semi-arid regions, they form an important source of stover for the livestock of these regions. Keywords: Fodder, Fodder quality, Green fodder, Millets, Stover THE farm communities in the semi-arid and arid nutrients is better in millet stovers as compared to regions of the country are dependent on crop slender straws of paddy and wheat.

Once the students become familiar with these basic concepts, they can easily understand the other properties of the soil, say physical and biological properties, pedology and soil fertility. To become an expert of soil fertility, comprehensive knowledge of all the soil properties is essential which in turn is supported by the knowledge of physical chemistry of soils and soil mineralogy. The present Textbook on ‘Physical Chemistry and Mineralogy of Soils’ has been written very cogently by the author who has been a teacher with an experience of nearly four decades of teaching in a premier Institute that is ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute. The book includes all the topics prescribed by ICAR for the Postgraduate students of Soil Science. The introductory chapter describes basic definitions of soil science. Chapters like ‘Bonding in solid structures’, ‘Elements of crystallography’, ‘Chemical thermodynamics’ and ‘Electrochemistry of soils and clays’ are basic in nature and have been dealt very lucidly for easy understanding of students. Two chapters on characterisation of soil minerals are practical oriented. Other chapters focus on the structures of soil minerals, weathering and formation of minerals in soil environment, adsorption and ion exchange on soil colloids, double layer theory of soil colloids–its evolution and application, chemisorption and precipitation reactions in soil, soil organic colloids and their properties and chemistry of submerged soil. This book will be very much useful for the Postgraduate students of Soil Science.

It is cultivated in about 23 countries of Asia, Africa and America. It is a self-pollinating, short-duration, drought tolerant and C4 cereal crop good as food for human consumption, feed for poultry and cage birds, and fodder for cattle; mainly cultivated in poor or marginal soils. It plays an important role in the world agriculture providing food to millions of people dependent on poor or marginal soils in southern Europe and in temperate, subtropical and tropical Asia.

In India, yield losses of 10–20% have been reported in millets due to insect pests. Shoot flies and stem borers are associated with millets and cause huge damage apart from many sucking pests. Few pests are newly observed attacking millets and few minor pests have become major in some regions. For most of the recently recorded pests, information on factors responsible for their outbreak, bionomics, yield losses etc is needed before planning their control operations. As an immediate remedy, chemicals have been used mainly on high yielding varieties and hybrids. However, a combination of cultural practices and resistant cultivars has proved to be effective.

Their rich nutritional properties and health benefits have enabled their revival and cultivation in the recent years. Millets are considered as nutri-cereals as they hold abundant nutritional benefits, food and fodder value, ecological benefits, reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers and are less sensitive to yield declines with lower inputs. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization reports state that “Compared to the more commonly known cereals such as wheat, rice or corn, millets are capable of growing under drought conditions, under non-irrigated conditions even in very low rainfall regimes, having a low water footprint”. Almost all the millet crops are well known for their hardiness which can withstand prolonged periods of drought, high temperatures and still yield grains and fodder. Hence, they are considered as climate smart crops.

Many limitations prevent or alter reproductive strategy of sorghum parental lines during hybrid seed production. Therefore, care must be taken for seed production that offer optimum climatic package during crop growth period. Seed certification agencies have an important role to play in certified hybrid seed production and distribution, because the crop performance is dependent on the quality of the certified seed used. Flowering behavior of the hybrid parents, productivity vs cost, and climatic conditions, particularly during the stages of flowering and seed filling should be important considerations to select an area for hybrid seed production.

SUMMARY Millet grains contain higher protein, fibre, calcium and mineral nutrients, and can ensure better nutrition to the poor people. Biofortification in millets is a feasible strategy to alleviate the micronutrient malnutrition among the rural poor. Several biofortified cultivars have been released in pearl millet for commercial cultivation and are being adopted by the farmers. The availability of high variability for grain micronutrient contents in sorghum and small millets holds promise to develop superior cultivars with enhanced nutritional quality. Wide adoption and consumption of such biofortified millets by micronutrient malnourished poor people will enhance the nutritional status and health condition of rural as well as urban population.

The stover from millets was an important component of livestock feed in integrated farming systems. Lack of diversity in food grains and excessive processing of rice and wheat has caused double burden of lifestyle diseases and malnutrition. Micronutrient deficiency is being manifested as ‘hidden hunger’ in many developing countries to which millets seem to be a probable salution. Millets like sorghum, pearl millet and finger millet are consumed as whole grains and are rich source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibre. Small millets like foxtail, proso, little, barnyard and kodo millets are also good source of nutrients when moderately polished after dehulling. Finger millet is a very rich source of calcium for growing children, pregnant women and elderly for maintaining bone health. Therefore, regular consumption of millets helps in diversification of diets and imparts many health benefits along with battling hidden hunger.

HANDBOOK OF Integrated Pest Management To reverse the loss of environmental resources and also to reduce biodiversity loss, the Government of India has Integrated Pest Management (IPM) as part of the National Agricultural Policy. Integrated Pest Management emphasizes the growth of a health crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms. IPM is not new – mechanical, cultural and biological tactics were used by farmers for hundreds of years before chemical pesticides became available. Besides, there are IPM techniques that have been developed more recently and are effective in suppressing pests without adversely affecting the environment. The task of spreading the message of IPM across is tough due to poor awareness about the subject among people in line-departments as also among the farmers. The information on integrated pest management as a whole is scattered. This Handbook comprehensively deals with all the aspects of integrated pest management in field crops, horticultural crops under traditional, protected systems. Information on basic strategies and tactics of different methods of management including mass production of biocontrol agents, IPM policy and pesticide registration is provided in comprehensive form. The Handbook of Integrated Pest Management comprises 82 chapters which are well written in lucid language with crispy sentences by the renowned scientists. The role of IPM is elucidated with different pests like Trichogramma, Bacillus thuringiensis, Nomuraea rileyi etc. and agricultural crops like rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, pulses, soybean, rapeseed mustard, groundnut, minor-oilseed crops, sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta, potato, vegetable crops, fruits, grapes, citrus, banana, pomegranate, coconut etc. This Handbook will provide information of available useful technologies to educate on how to reduce or judiciously use chemical pesticides, safeguard ourselves from chronic poisoning, save the National environment while also reducing input costs and raise farmers’ income. This compilation will be useful to teachers, students, trainers, line-department personnel and policy makers.

It is used as bird feed in the US, but is used for human consumption in many parts of the world including Russia, China, Korea and India. It is rich in protein and starch. The probable reason of proso millet in the first league of domesticated crops is its short-duration, minimum crop management, resilience to abiotic stress and being nutritionally rich.

Most of the fallow lands in summer can be brought into proso millet cultivation with limited irrigation, which will generate additional income if grown as an intercrop. Proso millet is a good source of plant-based protein and its value addition can enhance acceptance among consumers. The demand for millets has increased many folds, the market linkages are in incipient stage but sooner the market will face scarcity of raw material for making value added products. The major constraint of millet cultivation was yield, but with the availability of improved cultivars and practices, farmers can harvest profitable yields. *Corresponding author’s e-mail: avinash@millets.res.in Proso millet panicle Indian Farming 111 January 2023"}

It is one of the hardiest crops, drought tolerant with high yield potential and excellent storage properties. But, its production and consumption are on the decline due to various factors. Kodo poisoning is one of the major factors impeding its consumption and this problem needs an immediate attention for effective management. The fear of kodo poisoning has emerged as a serious economic constraint for kodo millet cultivation, consumption and popularisation. This article would help in management of kodo poisoning thereby enabling its prevention, and enhancing the consumption and popularisation.

They are major means of sustainable livelihood of poor in the dryland regions of the country providing both food and fodder requirement. However, their area has declined from 36.34 million ha (1955- 56) to 17.0 million ha (2011-12). The major causal factors responsible for such a decline in area of millet crops are; relatively higher demand and profitability of competing crops, lower market prices of millets vs. competing crops many of which are artificially supported, declining role as a food crop at aggregate level, urbanization, and income growth. One of the important determinants of millets economy is the consumption parameter. The consumption of millets in general declined overtime. Keywords: Commercial, Market, Millets, Value-addition THE contribution of coarse cereals (millets plus maize) was 10% of food grains in 2003-04 (16.5 kg /person/year). This has declined to 8% by 2011-12 (13.2 kg/person/year). The major determinants for this decline are changes in food habits, time-consuming and cumbersome procedure of food preparation and strong Community/SHG/KVK (Procurement) Farmer policy disincentives.
