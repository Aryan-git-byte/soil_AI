The experiment was conducted in a split plot design (SPD) with 4 replications. The experiment consisted of 3 sowing methods in main plots, viz. Flat row sowing; FIRB (Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed) sowing; and zero tillage sowing and 8 nutrient management practices, viz. 100% RDN through FYM as basal; RDN through FYM as basal + 50% RDN with first irrigation; 75% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation; 50% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + 25% RDN with second irrigation; 100% RDN through FYM as basal + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage; 50% RDN through FYM as basal + 50% RDN with first irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage; 75% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage; 50% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + 25% RDN with second irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage in sub plots. The experimental results revealed that the FIRB sowing method recorded significantly higher plant height at 45 DAS (42.56 and 42.66 cm) during both the years of study over zero tillage sowing method and remain at par with flat row sowing method, respectively. The same sowing method resulted into statistically higher grain yield (42.88 and 43.87 q/ha) and biological yield (106.89 and 108.48 q/ha) compared to flat row sowing and zero tillage sowing methods during both the years, respectively. During the second year of study (2023) significantly highest crop growth rate (CGR) (1.1240 g/m2/day) and relative growth rate (RGR) (0.0083 g/g/day) between 90 DAS to harvest were recorded with flat row sowing over zero tillage sowing and remain at par with FIRB sowing method. Regarding the nutrient management practices the highest plant height (43.43 and 44.51 cm), grain yield (44.52 and 44.84 q/ha) and biological yield (110.35 and 110.58 q/ha) were recorded with 75% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage.

The experiment was conducted in a split plot design (SPD) with 4 replications. The experiment consisted of 3 sowing methods in main plots, viz. Flat row sowing; FIRB (Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed) sowing; and zero tillage sowing and 8 nutrient management practices, viz. 100% RDN through FYM as basal; RDN through FYM as basal + 50% RDN with first irrigation; 75% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation; 50% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + 25% RDN with second irrigation; 100% RDN through FYM as basal + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage; 50% RDN through FYM as basal + 50% RDN with first irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage; 75% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage; 50% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + 25% RDN with second irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage in sub plots. The experimental results revealed that the FIRB sowing method recorded significantly higher plant height at 45 DAS (42.56 and 42.66 cm) during both the years of study over zero tillage sowing method and remain at par with flat row sowing method, respectively. The same sowing method resulted into statistically higher grain yield (42.88 and 43.87 q/ha) and biological yield (106.89 and 108.48 q/ha) compared to flat row sowing and zero tillage sowing methods during both the years, respectively. During the second year of study (2023) significantly highest crop growth rate (CGR) (1.1240 g/m2/day) and relative growth rate (RGR) (0.0083 g/g/day) between 90 DAS to harvest were recorded with flat row sowing over zero tillage sowing and remain at par with FIRB sowing method. Regarding the nutrient management practices the highest plant height (43.43 and 44.51 cm), grain yield (44.52 and 44.84 q/ha) and biological yield (110.35 and 110.58 q/ha) were recorded with 75% RDN through FYM as basal + 25% RDN with first irrigation + jeevamrit @500 litre/ha at sowing and first irrigation + panchagavya @5% at booting stage.
