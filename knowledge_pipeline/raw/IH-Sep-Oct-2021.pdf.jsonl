The official slogan of the campaign ‘Fruits and vegetables, your dietary essentials’ underlines the importance fruits and vegetables have in nutrition and overall health. The objectives of IYFV are to raise awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption; advocate for healthy diets through increased consumption of fruits and vegetables; promote international efforts to boost fruit and vegetable production and value chains in a sustainable and safe way; bring in focus on the need to reduce losses and waste in fruit and vegetable supply chains from production to consumption; and invite relevant stakeholders to strengthen the capacities of developing countries to adopt innovative approaches and technologies in combating loss and waste of fruits and vegetables. The IYFV 2021 is a step towards achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals. India is the second-largest producer of horticultural produce, producing about 12% of the global fruit and vegetable production. The Government of India has taken a plethora of steps to further boost the horticulture sector particularly fruits and vegetables. Speaking at a National Conference organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare in collaboration with the FAO as part of the celebration of the ‘International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, 2021’, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, told that to promote globally popular Exotic and important Indigenous fruit crops in the country, the Ministry has identified 10 globally popular Exotic fruit crops of commercial importance and 10 important Indigenous fruit crops with high nutritional and nutraceutical properties. A blueprint for area expansion for these crops has been provided to the State Horticulture Departments with set targets for the year 2021-22. During the current year, 8951 hectares area for exotic fruits and 7154 hectares area for indigenous fruits will be brought under cultivation. Operational guidelines for the Horticulture Cluster Development Programme have also been released. Measures have also been taken to promote the availability, accessibility and affordability of fruits and vegetables. The Government of India through the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture has enabled area expansion, development of nurseries and construction of farm ponds beside enabling investments in creation of post-harvest cold chain infrastructure. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the Government took lot of initiatives to build short and inclusive value chains for fruits and vegetables. FPOs were allowed to trade in their agricultural produce directly through online modalities. Similarly, farmers were allowed to trade online from registered warehouses too. ‘Kisan Rath’ app launched as a public-private partnership enabled small and marginal farmers to carry harvested agricultural produce, without delay, from the farmgate to regulated wholesale markets and warehouses. The ‘Kisan Rail’ and ‘Kisan Udaan’ initiatives have been launched to strengthen post-harvest rail and air connectivity. Our future line of action should focus on strengthening of integrated cold chains at farmgate pack houses; expanding the harvesting window by mainstreaming of fruits and vegetables even during offseason to increase availability; developing nutrient dense biofortified varieties and last but not the least, considering perennial fruit crops as a source of promoting clean environment. It goes without saying that our last mile, more than 700 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), need to be aggressively plugged into farmgate supply and value chains to advise on increasing productivity, yield and market reach of fruits and vegetables. I am hopeful that India can achieve the goal of bringing fruits and vegetables to the plate of the poorest of the poor, not as a special food but as a daily necessity. – Editor 2 Indian Horticulture"}

Vegetable production provides a promising economic opportunity for reducing rural poverty and unemployment in rural areas, and is a key component of farm diversification strategies. INDIA ranks second after China in vegetable production abroad. Therefore, to ensure the nutritional and income in the world and India’s contribution to the total security of the growing population of the country, it is vegetable production of the world is 14%. Vegetable very necessary to increase the production of vegetables. cultivation in India is done from the mountainous regions of the Himalayas in the north to the coastal parts of Current status the sea located in the south.

On one hand, vegetables are being wasted in India due to lack of storage and processing while on the other hand, the problem of malnutrition is widespread in the country. The recently published National Family Health Survey data showed that 79.2% of the 6-35 months old children in our country are suffering from anaemia. The problem of malnutrition in our country can be tackled by including more vegetables in the diet. According to an estimate, by the year 2030, the population of the country will be around 145 crore and more than 263 million tonnes of vegetable production will be required to cater the demands of growing population. With more production of vegetables, we will be able to consume more vegetables to fulfill the requirements of essential nutrients in our food, and also get more foreign Fig. 1.

The consumption of spices is growing in the country with increase in purchasing power. It is envisaged that everyone in India would be consuming one spice or the other with a high per capita consumption. This may increase further due to rapid urbanization which needs spices as natural food preservatives. Growing demand from the emerging segment of nutraceuticals is driving the global consumption of Indian spices further at a time when the country is straining to meet the needs of the traditional food sector. Though spices contains diverse array of phytochemicals, the nutraceutical preparation often revolve around few major bioactive metabolites. Non-traditional use of spices including nutraceuticals now accounts for nearly 15% of spice production in India, estimated at 50 lakh tonne a year.

High density orchards were first planted in Europe at the end of the 19th century and since then there is decline in traditional orchards with low densities. The underlying principle of HDP is to make the best use of vertical and horizontal space per unit time and to harness maximum possible return per unit of output. Standard apple plants raised on seedling rootstocks are planted at a spacing of 6×6 m to 7×7 m with a planting density of 204-278 trees/ha and spur varieties on seedling rootstocks are planted at a spacing of 5.0×5.0 m with a planting density of 400 plants/ ha. The average productivity of these orchards is approximately 10 to 12 MT/ha, which is much below the productivity obtained in high-density orchards (60-80 MT/ha).

Despite the economic importance of the coconut palm, coconut production continued to show stagnancy in production, productivity and trade in the recent decade. The coconut sector in the past has been dominated by copra and coconut oil, and the international coconut trade used to be driven by the demand for coconut oil. However, demand for coconut oil has witnessed a sharp decline during the last decades due to increased competition from other edible oils, such as palm oil and soybean. Furthermore, there is a changing trend wherein coconut is increasingly being processed into diversified value-added products in recent times. This emerging trend has influenced the current production, processing and trading system in coconut. To take advantage of these newfound opportunities in the world market, coconut growers must look into the trade patterns, performance and global competitiveness of coconut and coconut products. At present, the market trends indicate consumer choice and acceptance of the various products of coconut. Growth rates in export volumes continue to increase each year for Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) by 30%, Coconut Water by 150%, Coconut Milk/Cream/ Powder by 50%, Desiccated Coconut by 30%, Coconut Flour by 115% and similar trends for other emerging products. Taking a cue from the changed scenario in the coconut sector, the Kalpa Agri-Business Incubator functioning under ICAR-CPCRI provides much- needed handholding to the startup entrepreneurs in the sector.

According to an estimate around 700 million tons alarming issues related to dwindling natural resources like of crop residues are generated per year and most of it is land and water. Mushroom cultivation is typical example of left unutilized which creates environmental pollution. A huge amount of paddy straw and stubbles are burnt in the fields every year especially in north India. This practice of burning paddy straw and dumping of other agricultural wastes affect the quality of air, soil and water in addition to the life of farm animals and the microclimate of the crop. Mushroom farms can utilize this agricultural waste for growing mushrooms. Mushroom mycelium produces extracellular enzymes such as ligninases, cellulases, and laccases, which can degrade and utilize diverse crop residues and reduce pollution. Mushrooms also play an important role in synthesizing non-toxic nano- particles of metals from their salts. Hence, mushroom farming is an eco-friendly sustainable technology, which produces nutritive and medicinal fruiting bodies utilizing Fig. 2.

Swaminathan, the Father of Green Revolution in India. Horticulture forms an integral and important component in the economy of a nation. Horticultural crops constitute a significant segment of the total agricultural production of a country. The importance of horticulture can be substantiated by its benefits like high export value, high per unit area yield, high returns per unit area, best utilization of wasteland, provision of raw materials for industries, whole engagement by a grower/labourer, production of more food energy per unit area than that of field crops, better use of undulating lands, and stabilization of women’s empowerment by providing employment opportunities through processing, floriculture, seed production, mushroom cultivation, nursery preparation, etc. In addition, fruits and vegetables constitute the important energy-giving material to the human body. It also improves the economic condition of many farmers, and it has become a means of improving livelihood for many unprivileged classes too. Flower harvesting, nursery maintenance, hybrid seed production and tissue culture, propagation of fruits and flowers, and food processing are highly remunerative employment options for women in rural areas.

Giant granadilla is mostly found in Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. The distribution of HCN (cyanogenic glucosides) in the leaves, stems, tendrils, floral parts, roots are reported up to 138 ppm. The greenish-yellow fruits of P. quadrangularis resemble as melons and are the largest in the genus. Fruit flesh is very thick and number of seeds are about 164 per fruits. Shrink wrapping of Pasighat Local Red Purple passion (Passiflora edulis Sims) Purple passion fruit showed high level of protein, fat and ascorbic acid than the giant granadilla and yellow type. It requires higher elevation (about 2000 m) for proper flowering and fruiting. Temperature below 15°C restrict the vegetative growth and flowering. Fruits are 4-5 cm in diameter, deep purple when ripe each weighing 35- 45 g. The juice content varies from 31-35%. The protein and vitamin C content is about 9.4% and 24-30 mg/100 g respectively.

To increase the shelf-life and market value of the passion fruit, use of shrink wrapping helps, leading directly Fruit and flower morphology to upliftment of the economy of rural people of North East Region of India. The post-harvest life of passion fruits can be effectively increased by polyolefin film packaging which helps to maintain the quality of fruits under good condition, reducing the percentage loss of fresh matter content and shrinkage of rind portion. Overwrapping freshly harvested fruits and vegetables by using highly permeable films like HDPE, LDPE, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), etc. helps to maintain the post-harvest quality and extends the shelf-life by minimising transpiration and respiration.

Growth form Slender, single-trunked palm Leaf The leaves are pinnatisect and consist of a sheath, a rachis and leaflets. The leaf sheath completely encircles the stem. The average length of leaf is 1.65 m, which bears about 70 leaflets (varies with the vigour of the palm and fertility of the soil). Varieties and Hybrids Tall varieties: Sumangala, Sreemangala, Mohitnagar, Swarnamangala, Kahikuchi Tall, Madhuramangala and Nalbari; Semi-Tall varieties: Mangala and Shatamangala; Dwarf hybrids: VTLAH-1, VTLAH-2. Inflorescence type Spadix Arecanut leaf sheath powder as cattle feed Pollination Highly cross-pollinated Pollen agents The sweet-scented male flowers are visited by bees and other insects for nectar, but insects have not been observed visiting the female flowers.

Soil should be deep to ensure a well-developed root system with high organic carbon content and a pH range from acidic to neutral. Propagation technique Seeds and tissue culture (Somatic embryogenesis) Spacing and planting The optimum spacing for planting arecanut is 2.7 m x 2.7 m. Wider spacing of 3.3 m x 3.3 m is advisable for accommodating Arecanut leaf sheath high value inter/ mixed crops. Crops like cocoa, pepper, banana, acid lime, cardamom, coffee, tea, nutmeg, vegetables, flower crops, medicinal and aromatic plants, etc. can be grown in arecanut gardens. Shading Arecanut plants are sensitive to sun scorching. Shade plants may be planted along the borders on South-West side. If planting of shade trees is not possible, exposure to sun can be avoided by covering the stem with arecanut or coconut leaves. Nutrient management Nutrient management strategies need to be planned for arecanut considering the soil fertility status. Application of Arecanut leaf sheeth plates 100 g N, 40 g PO and 140 g KO is recommended as a general dose of fertilizer every year. In addition, application of 2 5 2 12 kg each of green leaf and compost per palm is also recommended. The organic manure and 50% of recommended dose of fertilizers i.e. 110 g urea, 100 g rock phosphate and 117 g muriate of potash can be applied during September- October after opening the basin. Same dose of fertilizers can be applied during February-March. Fertilizers should be applied around the palm at a distance of 45-50 cm from the trunk. Water management Arecanut cannot withstand drought and invariably needs irrigation during rainless period. In drip irrigation, about 16-20 litres of water per day per palm is required based on evaporation rate. Drainage It is essential to ensure adequate drainage by providing drainage channels in high rainfall areas. The channel should be at least 15-30 cm deeper than the depth at which the seedlings are planted. Arecanut soap Yield Dry kernel or chali yield varies from 2.54-4.15 kg/palm/year in different genotypes Market price Market price depends on size and quality of dry kernel (chali). Present market price is R 440-510 per kg. Pests and diseases The arecanut palm is prone to the attack of many insect and non-insect pests. Some of the arecanut pests include root grub (Leucopholis spp.), spindle bug (Mircarvalhoia arecae), pentatomid bug (Halyomorpha picus), Mites: Red mite (Raoiella indica) and white mite (Oligonychus indicus), inflorescence caterpillar (Tirathaba sp.), scale insect (Aonidiella orientalis and Ischnaapsis longinostris), etc. Diseases such as fruit rot, bud rot, crown rot, yellow leaf disease, basal stem rot, inflorescence dieback etc., affects arecanut plant health.

The official slogan of the campaign ‘Fruits and vegetables, your dietary essentials’ underlines the importance fruits and vegetables have in nutrition and overall health. The objectives of IYFV are to raise awareness of the health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption; advocate for healthy diets through increased consumption of fruits and vegetables; promote international efforts to boost fruit and vegetable production and value chains in a sustainable and safe way; bring in focus on the need to reduce losses and waste in fruit and vegetable supply chains from production to consumption; and invite relevant stakeholders to strengthen the capacities of developing countries to adopt innovative approaches and technologies in combating loss and waste of fruits and vegetables. The IYFV 2021 is a step towards achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals. India is the second-largest producer of horticultural produce, producing about 12% of the global fruit and vegetable production. The Government of India has taken a plethora of steps to further boost the horticulture sector particularly fruits and vegetables. Speaking at a National Conference organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare in collaboration with the FAO as part of the celebration of the ‘International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, 2021’, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Narendra Singh Tomar, told that to promote globally popular Exotic and important Indigenous fruit crops in the country, the Ministry has identified 10 globally popular Exotic fruit crops of commercial importance and 10 important Indigenous fruit crops with high nutritional and nutraceutical properties. A blueprint for area expansion for these crops has been provided to the State Horticulture Departments with set targets for the year 2021-22. During the current year, 8951 hectares area for exotic fruits and 7154 hectares area for indigenous fruits will be brought under cultivation. Operational guidelines for the Horticulture Cluster Development Programme have also been released. Measures have also been taken to promote the availability, accessibility and affordability of fruits and vegetables. The Government of India through the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture has enabled area expansion, development of nurseries and construction of farm ponds beside enabling investments in creation of post-harvest cold chain infrastructure. During the COVID-19 lockdown, the Government took lot of initiatives to build short and inclusive value chains for fruits and vegetables. FPOs were allowed to trade in their agricultural produce directly through online modalities. Similarly, farmers were allowed to trade online from registered warehouses too. ‘Kisan Rath’ app launched as a public-private partnership enabled small and marginal farmers to carry harvested agricultural produce, without delay, from the farmgate to regulated wholesale markets and warehouses. The ‘Kisan Rail’ and ‘Kisan Udaan’ initiatives have been launched to strengthen post-harvest rail and air connectivity. Our future line of action should focus on strengthening of integrated cold chains at farmgate pack houses; expanding the harvesting window by mainstreaming of fruits and vegetables even during offseason to increase availability; developing nutrient dense biofortified varieties and last but not the least, considering perennial fruit crops as a source of promoting clean environment. It goes without saying that our last mile, more than 700 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), need to be aggressively plugged into farmgate supply and value chains to advise on increasing productivity, yield and market reach of fruits and vegetables. I am hopeful that India can achieve the goal of bringing fruits and vegetables to the plate of the poorest of the poor, not as a special food but as a daily necessity. – Editor 2 Indian Horticulture"}

The consumption of spices is growing in the country with increase in purchasing power. It is envisaged that everyone in India would be consuming one spice or the other with a high per capita consumption. This may increase further due to rapid urbanization which needs spices as natural food preservatives. Growing demand from the emerging segment of nutraceuticals is driving the global consumption of Indian spices further at a time when the country is straining to meet the needs of the traditional food sector. Though spices contains diverse array of phytochemicals, the nutraceutical preparation often revolve around few major bioactive metabolites. Non-traditional use of spices including nutraceuticals now accounts for nearly 15% of spice production in India, estimated at 50 lakh tonne a year.

High density orchards were first planted in Europe at the end of the 19th century and since then there is decline in traditional orchards with low densities. The underlying principle of HDP is to make the best use of vertical and horizontal space per unit time and to harness maximum possible return per unit of output. Standard apple plants raised on seedling rootstocks are planted at a spacing of 6×6 m to 7×7 m with a planting density of 204-278 trees/ha and spur varieties on seedling rootstocks are planted at a spacing of 5.0×5.0 m with a planting density of 400 plants/ ha. The average productivity of these orchards is approximately 10 to 12 MT/ha, which is much below the productivity obtained in high-density orchards (60-80 MT/ha).

The coconut sector in the past has been dominated by copra and coconut oil, and the international coconut trade used to be driven by the demand for coconut oil. However, demand for coconut oil has witnessed a sharp decline during the last decades due to increased competition from other edible oils, such as palm oil and soybean. Furthermore, there is a changing trend wherein coconut is increasingly being processed into diversified value-added products in recent times. This emerging trend has influenced the current production, processing and trading system in coconut. To take advantage of these newfound opportunities in the world market, coconut growers must look into the trade patterns, performance and global competitiveness of coconut and coconut products. At present, the market trends indicate consumer choice and acceptance of the various products of coconut. Growth rates in export volumes continue to increase each year for Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) by 30%, Coconut Water by 150%, Coconut Milk/Cream/ Powder by 50%, Desiccated Coconut by 30%, Coconut Flour by 115% and similar trends for other emerging products. Taking a cue from the changed scenario in the coconut sector, the Kalpa Agri-Business Incubator functioning under ICAR-CPCRI provides much- needed handholding to the startup entrepreneurs in the sector. Production scenario Odisha, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam and Bihar, which According to the latest production statistics brought account for nearly 8% of production.

Different types of mushrooms viz. white button (Agaricus bisporus), oyster (Pleurotus spp.), paddy straw (Volvariella volvacea), milky (Calocybe indica) and shiitake (Lentinula edodes) mushroom with a total production of about 2.43 lakh tonnes are being cultivated on commercial scale in India because of its diversified agro-climatic conditions. Mushrooms have been recognized to contain highest and quality protein per unit area from agro-wastes generating employment, improving economic status of growers, checking pollution and earning foreign exchange. They also restore the environment by playing a role in degrading the pesticides and persisting chemicals. The spent mushroom substrate after cropping, remain as a good source of protein and other nutrients for animal feed. Mushrooms with their good nutritional, medicinal and functional properties are considered as a health food as they contain low calories, high protein, dietary fibre, vitamins, and minerals with high antioxidant capacity.

According to an estimate around 700 million tons alarming issues related to dwindling natural resources like of crop residues are generated per year and most of it is land and water. Mushroom cultivation is typical example of left unutilized which creates environmental pollution. A huge amount of paddy straw and stubbles are burnt in the fields every year especially in north India. This practice of burning paddy straw and dumping of other agricultural wastes affect the quality of air, soil and water in addition to the life of farm animals and the microclimate of the crop. Mushroom farms can utilize this agricultural waste for growing mushrooms. Mushroom mycelium produces extracellular enzymes such as ligninases, cellulases, and laccases, which can degrade and utilize diverse crop residues and reduce pollution. Mushrooms also play an important role in synthesizing non-toxic nano- particles of metals from their salts.

Swaminathan, the Father of Green Revolution in India. Horticulture forms an integral and important component in the economy of a nation. Horticultural crops constitute a significant segment of the total agricultural production of a country. The importance of horticulture can be substantiated by its benefits like high export value, high per unit area yield, high returns per unit area, best utilization of wasteland, provision of raw materials for industries, whole engagement by a grower/labourer, production of more food energy per unit area than that of field crops, better use of undulating lands, and stabilization of women’s empowerment by providing employment opportunities through processing, floriculture, seed production, mushroom cultivation, nursery preparation, etc. In addition, fruits and vegetables constitute the important energy-giving material to the human body. It also improves the economic condition of many farmers, and it has become a means of improving livelihood for many unprivileged classes too. Flower harvesting, nursery maintenance, hybrid seed production and tissue culture, propagation of fruits and flowers, and food processing are highly remunerative employment options for women in rural areas. Wide range of horticulture vitamins and minerals, but eating them reduces the risk India has been bestowed with wide range of climate of diseases.

Many changes have also taken place in the crop-production technologies. And this necessitated the revision of the earlier publication brought out in 2002. The revised textbook is in two volumes: First is covering Foodgrains and second is on Commercial Crops. The discipline of Agronomy has no longer remained mere field trials without application of discoveries emanating from the related disciplines of Genetics, Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, Plant Biochemistry, etc. The future Agronomy Landscape will face challenges of climate change, transboundary issues, TRIPS and other trade-related barriers, biotic and abiotic stresses, consequences of biotechnology and genetic engineering and increased market demands in terms of quality assurance, customized food crops, global competition, ecosystem services on land and social equities etc. The Agronomy must measure up to these futuristic challenges with well-defined metrics and methodologies for performance. The advent of hydroponics, precision farming, bio-sensors, fertigation, landscaping, application of ICT, GPS and GIS tools and micro-irrigation is in the horizon. This revised edition in two volumes covers fundamentals of the subject and at the same time will inspire and prepare teachers and students for the emerging frontiers.

It is popularly known as ‘betelnut’ or ‘supari’. Botanical name and Areca catechu L., 2n=32 chromosome number Family Arecaceae Origin The Malaya Archipelago, the Philippines and other East Indies islands Economic part Nut (seed endosperm/ dry kernel), leaf sheath Arecanut dry kernel or Uses Mastication, medicine and is an essential requisite for several religious and social ceremonies, leaf sheaths are used for chali making cups, plates, spoons, hats, leaf sheath is also used as alternate fodder for livestock. Growth form Slender, single-trunked palm Leaf The leaves are pinnatisect and consist of a sheath, a rachis and leaflets. The leaf sheath completely encircles the stem. The average length of leaf is 1.65 m, which bears about 70 leaflets (varies with the vigour of the palm and fertility of the soil). Varieties and Hybrids Tall varieties: Sumangala, Sreemangala, Mohitnagar, Swarnamangala, Kahikuchi Tall, Madhuramangala and Nalbari; Semi-Tall varieties: Mangala and Shatamangala; Dwarf hybrids: VTLAH-1, VTLAH-2. Inflorescence type Spadix Arecanut leaf sheath powder as cattle feed Pollination Highly cross-pollinated Pollen agents The sweet-scented male flowers are visited by bees and other insects for nectar, but insects have not been observed visiting the female flowers. It is thought that most of the flowers are wind pollinated. Anthesis Morning hours Stigma receptivity Up to 6 days Climate and Soil Altitude: 0-1000 mMSL, Mean annual temperature: 14°C-36°C, Mean annual rainfall: 750-4500 mm. Soil should be deep to ensure a well-developed root system with high organic carbon content and a pH range from acidic to neutral. Propagation technique Seeds and tissue culture (Somatic embryogenesis) Spacing and planting The optimum spacing for planting arecanut is 2.7 m x 2.7 m. Wider spacing of 3.3 m x 3.3 m is advisable for accommodating Arecanut leaf sheath high value inter/ mixed crops. Crops like cocoa, pepper, banana, acid lime, cardamom, coffee, tea, nutmeg, vegetables, flower crops, medicinal and aromatic plants, etc. can be grown in arecanut gardens. Shading Arecanut plants are sensitive to sun scorching. Shade plants may be planted along the borders on South-West side. If planting of shade trees is not possible, exposure to sun can be avoided by covering the stem with arecanut or coconut leaves. Nutrient management Nutrient management strategies need to be planned for arecanut considering the soil fertility status. Application of Arecanut leaf sheeth plates 100 g N, 40 g PO and 140 g KO is recommended as a general dose of fertilizer every year. In addition, application of 2 5 2 12 kg each of green leaf and compost per palm is also recommended. The organic manure and 50% of recommended dose of fertilizers i.e. 110 g urea, 100 g rock phosphate and 117 g muriate of potash can be applied during September- October after opening the basin. Same dose of fertilizers can be applied during February-March. Fertilizers should be applied around the palm at a distance of 45-50 cm from the trunk. Water management Arecanut cannot withstand drought and invariably needs irrigation during rainless period. In drip irrigation, about 16-20 litres of water per day per palm is required based on evaporation rate. Drainage It is essential to ensure adequate drainage by providing drainage channels in high rainfall areas. The channel should be at least 15-30 cm deeper than the depth at which the seedlings are planted. Arecanut soap Yield Dry kernel or chali yield varies from 2.54-4.15 kg/palm/year in different genotypes Market price Market price depends on size and quality of dry kernel (chali). Present market price is R 440-510 per kg. Pests and diseases The arecanut palm is prone to the attack of many insect and non-insect pests. Some of the arecanut pests include root grub (Leucopholis spp.), spindle bug (Mircarvalhoia arecae), pentatomid bug (Halyomorpha picus), Mites: Red mite (Raoiella indica) and white mite (Oligonychus indicus), inflorescence caterpillar (Tirathaba sp.), scale insect (Aonidiella orientalis and Ischnaapsis longinostris), etc. Diseases such as fruit rot, bud rot, crown rot, yellow leaf disease, basal stem rot, inflorescence dieback etc., affects arecanut plant health.
