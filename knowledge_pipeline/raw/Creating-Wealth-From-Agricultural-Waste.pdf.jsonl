Gross fixed capital formation in agriculture is recorded as 16.5% of Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2019-20. Right from the Kashmir to the coast of Kanya Kumari and from North eastern states to the desserts of Rajasthan the country is involved in a number of agricultural activities. The most commonly followed cropping system in the country is rice – wheat based but horticulture, fisheries and animal husbandry also plays very important role in the country’s economy. We have been witnessing that, while agriculture is contributing towards the food & nutritional security of our people, and economic growth of the country, improper management of agricultural waste generated in the process has been contributing towards mounting air, soil and water pollution. India generates about 350 million tonnes of agricultural waste every year. As per the estimates given by the ministry of new and renewable energy, this waste can generate more than 18,000 MW of power every year apart from generating green fertilizer for use in agriculture. Globally about 1.3 billion tonnes of food products for human consumption gets wasted or lost every year and about one-third of biodegradable municipal solid waste mainly comprise of domestic kitchen waste generated from households. This intern generates obnoxious gases and GHGs besides foul odour, around the landfill sites. Taking a single crop of potato for example, a total world potato waste is estimated to be 12 million tonnes per annum out of which 2 million tonnes of potato waste is generated in India alone. With the launching of the flagship scheme “Swachh Bharat Mission” by Government of India in 2014, Indian Council of Agricultural Research took a clarion call to work importantly on the waste generated from agricultural practices and convert it into products that are useful either for humans, animals or for farm land. All the ICAR Institutes together with KVKs under ATARIs acted on these issues giving due priority and have come out with number of"}

Indian Council of Agricultural Research being an integral part of Indian agriculture research realized the importance of management of waste generated during agricultural practices. The Council moved towards initiating research which focused on the management of agricultural waste together with converting it into some useful products, thereby generating wealth from waste. Consequently, all the ICAR institutes intensified efforts towards developing targeted technologies that are helpful in converting the agro-waste into some income generating product with minimal inputs. This compendium is all about these technologies and gives us a birds-eye-view to novel technologies giving us opportunity to covert waste into wealth. The compendium includes technologies converting agricultural crop waste, horticultural waste, animal or fisheries waste management which are either commercialized or are in advanced stage of commercialization. This book is intended to be a reference material for the related stakeholders including individuals, cooperatives or such other institutions who intend to venture into this area for livelihood options.

The non-root biomass of cassava includes stem and leaves. The stem to root ratio varied between 0.19 to 0.85 with an average value of 0.50, which depends on the growing location, variety, and maturity of the crops while harvest. Cassava is propagated through stem cuttings and only 15% is required for the planting, and only a small proportion for domestic fuel and the rest is reincorporated into the soil or burned off in the field itself. Hence, by considering the stem to root ratio of 0.50, in India the total quantity of cassava stem comes about 2.33 million tonnes. The cassava stem contains, about 15-39% starch, 22.80-40% cellulose, 10-28.8% hemi cellulose, and 11.8-22.10% ligninon dry wt. basis.

Gross fixed capital formation in agriculture is recorded as 16.5% of Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2019-20. Right from the Kashmir to the coast of Kanya Kumari and from North eastern states to the desserts of Rajasthan the country is involved in a number of agricultural activities. The most commonly followed cropping system in the country is rice – wheat based but horticulture, fisheries and animal husbandry also plays very important role in the country’s economy. We have been witnessing that, while agriculture is contributing towards the food & nutritional security of our people, and economic growth of the country, improper management of agricultural waste generated in the process has been contributing towards mounting air, soil and water pollution. India generates about 350 million tonnes of agricultural waste every year. As per the estimates given by the ministry of new and renewable energy, this waste can generate more than 18,000 MW of power every year apart from generating green fertilizer for use in agriculture. Globally about 1.3 billion tonnes of food products for human consumption gets wasted or lost every year and about one-third of biodegradable municipal solid waste mainly comprise of domestic kitchen waste generated from households. This intern generates obnoxious gases and GHGs besides foul odour, around the landfill sites. Taking a single crop of potato for example, a total world potato waste is estimated to be 12 million tonnes per annum out of which 2 million tonnes of potato waste is generated in India alone. With the launching of the flagship scheme “Swachh Bharat Mission” by Government of India in 2014, Indian Council of Agricultural Research took a clarion call to work importantly on the waste generated from agricultural practices and convert it into products that are useful either for humans, animals or for farm land.

In the year 2019 an updated version of the model was introduced with a mild steel-based digester constructed and installed as an external unit. This model biogas plant is functioning efficiently for providing training and demonstrations on waste management to the farmers as well as for the domestic use at the KVK for general cooking purposes in routine activities. status of Technology Transfer: Technology is ready for upscaling and transfer. salient Feature The paddy straw biogas plant is a mild steel digester of 20 quintal capacity. It has to be filled with both paddy straw (16 quintals) and cow dung (4 quintals). The filling of biogas digester is to be done in alternate layers of cow dung and paddy straw for proper mixing material. The amount of gas produced is 3-4 cubic meter per day. An ideally filled biogas plant can produce gas equivalent to 2.5-3 LPG cylinders of gas per month. It can further lead to a saving of Rs 2500-3000 per month. However, the flame produced by biogas is weaker than the LPG cylinder which leads to more cooking time. The total cost of the biogas plant is Rs 2,15,000. Benefits Since the initial installation of the biogas plant is quite costly for individual farmer. The model is more viable on community level as the cost of the plant will come down per household. In coming time adoption of this technology is imminent as a cheaper alternative to LPG cylinders.
