Introduction India being the second largest wheat producer in the direct correlation with improved genetic yield gains world provides 13% of global wheat supply (FAO, 2018). in wheat. Selection techniques based on physiological Traditional breeding approaches are limited by the parameters are now being evaluated for their role as low genetic variability, complexity of stress tolerance supplementary tool in wheat breeding at CIMMYT traits and yield components and the lack of efficient (Reynold et al., 2001). Identification of dependable selection techniques under stress conditions. Although screening methods and efficient selection criteria the physiological tolerance indices (osmotic adjustment, with physiological input remains a major challenge in membrane stability, relative water content etc.) are traditional breeding programme. Physiological-trait- not directly related to yield but their use might prove based breeding is also good strategy and has merit over increasingly useful. Integration of these physiological traits breeding for yield per se because it increases the probability complimented with efficient breeding methodologies will of crosses resulting in additive gene action, although drive the present research to the required yield heights. considerable investment in germplasm characterization Several researches identified physiological traits having is prerequisite. 317"}

In general, the treatments for agronomic traits viz., days to heading, change in plant architecture, coleoptile elongation, growth plant height, flag leaf width, number of productive tillers inhibition, scorching of leaves and stems, leaf abscission per meter, spike length, grain yield and thousand grains and senescence are some characteristic symptoms of weight. physiological injuries which have been observed under elevated temperatures and which consequently lead Physiological traits: Data of leaf area index, canopy to reduced plant productivity (Tian et al., 2014).

NDVI was improving the efficiency of wheat breeding. measured with the help of hand held Trimble GreenSeeker and was recorded at following eight growth stages: Repeated measures are consecutive data obtained over time from the same experimental units such as plants NDVI 1 (seedling growth stage) or animals (Littell et al., 1996) and the objectives are to NDVI 2 (tillering stage) examine and compare response trends over time. The comparisons of treatments can be at specific times, or NDVI 3 (stem elongation stage) averaged over time and it also can involve comparisons NDVI 4 (inflorescence emergence stage) of times within a treatment (Littell et al., 1998). Repeated NDVI 5 (anthesis stage) ANOVA is applied traditionally for statistical analysis of data including between-subject and within-subject factors NDVI 6 (milk development stage) and is used safely when sphericity assumption is provided NDVI 7 (soft dough stage) (Eyduran and Akbas, 2010).

However, as little visual variation is present between genotypes, but this may be a very small set of genotypes to infer any our findings suggest that NDVI measurement at different correlation, the results do cohere with the overall outcome stages would help in more precise selection of genotypes of the study.

In general, the treatments for agronomic traits viz., days to heading, change in plant architecture, coleoptile elongation, growth plant height, flag leaf width, number of productive tillers inhibition, scorching of leaves and stems, leaf abscission per meter, spike length, grain yield and thousand grains and senescence are some characteristic symptoms of weight. physiological injuries which have been observed under elevated temperatures and which consequently lead Physiological traits: Data of leaf area index, canopy to reduced plant productivity (Tian et al., 2014).

The optimal with days to heading, overall yield and thousand grains stages for measuring NDVI vary depending on the weight trait. In the present environment, the grain filling germplasm and environment and little attention is paid by occurs in high temperatures and genotypes showing faster the different breeding programmes for field observations utilization of green matter showed higher yield. However, as little visual variation is present between genotypes, but this may be a very small set of genotypes to infer any our findings suggest that NDVI measurement at different correlation, the results do cohere with the overall outcome stages would help in more precise selection of genotypes of the study. The findings of present investigation have as there exists significant variation among high and low implications for wheat improvement programmes for yielding genotypes at different growth stages.
